"""
Python has two primitive loop commands:

while loops
for loops
"""

#With the while loop we can execute a set of statements 
#as long as a condition is true.

#Print i as long as i is less than 6:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
  
  
#With the break statement we can stop
#the loop even if the while condition is true:

#Exit the loop when i is 3:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
  
#With the continue statement
#we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

#Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
  

#Print a message once the condition is false:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
