Python Classes/Objects
Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

'''

#To create a class, use the keyword class:
#Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass:
  x = 5
#Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)

#You can delete objects by using the del keyword:
#Delete the p1 object:

del p1

#You can create multiple objects from the same class:
#Create three objects from the MyClass class:

p1 = MyClass()
p2 = MyClass()
p3 = MyClass()

print(p1.x)
print(p2.x)
print(p3.x)

The pass Statement
class definitions cannot be empty, 
but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, 
put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
